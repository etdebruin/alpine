# Alpine For PHP

## Setting up your app to use Alpine For PHP

Easiest way is to `git pull` Alpine For PHP into your app folder and `require alpine/autoloader.php`.  A4 will autoload all the classes in your app's `model/` folder.

Make sure that you name your file the same as your class, i.e. your User class should be in model/user.php.
